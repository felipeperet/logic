# logic library

This is an attempt at formalizing different logics and deductive systems.

## Agda

Agda is a dependently typed functional language developed by Norell at the Chalmers University of Technology as his Ph.D. Thesis. It also works as a interactive proof assistant, because of the Curry-Howard correspondence.

The current library release works with Agda-2.6.2 and stdlib-1.5.
